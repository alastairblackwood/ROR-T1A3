R4 Software Development Plan

My terminal application is a game titled 'The Ranger Of Redoc'. It's based on the classic 1980's Fantasy Adventure text based computer games, where the player selects a path they wish to go down which then outputs a new part of the story. The story itself follows the final part of the hero's journey to enter the Forbidden Forest Of Ybur. His mission is to find and destroy the Beast that has terrorized the world for so long, while avoiding death himself and returning safely to his home at the end.

It starts by outputting a welcome message with the game title and then requests the users name. After the user enters their name, the story introduction runs and then the app prompts the user to input 'help' to see a list of possible commands.

The commands it offers are North, South, East, West, Attack and Quit. Selecting North will take the user to a particular area of the story, where they are blocked and have to return South back into the Forest.

Because the application is a game, there is no specific problem it will solve, other than boredom for the player, through providing a source of entertainment. The reason I chose to develop a game was purely from a place of nostalgia, to re-visit my childhood which was formed through playing text-based terminal application games like The Hobbit. I felt that it would a fun application to make and be a great motivator to see it through to the end.

The target audience is for video gamers of a similar demographic to me (mid 30s early 40s) who also grew up with text based video games and would enjoy the nostalgia of playing a new game that encompasses those elements.

A member of the target audience will use it by downloading the programme and simply have fun playing it.

R6 Three Features (100 words each)
Variables concept of variable scope
Loops and conditional control structures
Error handling

R7 Outline Of the User Interaction and Experience for App

- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

R8 Control Flow Diagram

R9 Develop implementation plan: - outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature

- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

R10 Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:

- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements

R17 Design TWO tests:
Each test should:

- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application

R19 Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:
For example,

- writing a script which turns the application into an executable; OR
- packaging the application for use as a module or dependency
